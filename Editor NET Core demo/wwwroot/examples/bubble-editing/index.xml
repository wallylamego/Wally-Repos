<info><![CDATA[

Editor has three different Editor modes:

* Primary editing
* Bubble editing
* Inline editing

The examples in this section show the bubble editing option, which displays one or more form fields in a bubble above the fields being edited.

Bubble editing is designed to have all the fast editing options of inline editing (i.e. a single click to activate) without the potential layout issues that inline editing presents (for example a `textarea` or wysiwyg input control wouldn't fit into a table without causing the cell to resize).
