Plug-ins provide the ultimate way to customise Editor to your exact needs. There are two primary types of plug-in Editor provides for:

* Field type plug-ins - create custom field types for your data
* Display controller plug-ins - define how you want the form to be displayed

The examples in this section show how these two types of plug-ins can be defined and used in Editor.
