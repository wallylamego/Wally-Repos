<info><![CDATA[

Editor's primary use is as an Editor for [DataTables](//datatables.net). However, it can also be used as a standalone form editor, which can be useful for single dimension configuration parameters (i.e. those that don't directly lend themselves to display in a table) and also as a collection editor. This ensures a consistent interface for your end users in their form editing, and for you in your development API.

The examples in this section show how Editor can be used in its standalone mode.
