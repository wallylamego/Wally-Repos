Editor features a built in date time picker through the `e-field datetime` field type. This control presents the end user with a graphical calendar that can be used to easily enter both dates and times.

Out of the box, ISO8601 is the date / time format that is supported, but with [Momentjs](http://momentjs.com/) integration, the date time selector can work with any format of date and time information you require.
